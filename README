Project structure
1. src - scala & java files
2. Jars - .jar files & .class files to use for experiements
3. Project - configuration files in which input files, output directory, and some setting values are described

Prerequisites
1. install scala plugin - refer to http://www.scala-ide.org/ & install appropriate version of scala plugin
2. edit .in file in Project directory
3. select src/experiments/Main.scala
4. Run as Scala application
5. Type in file in Console Tab - e.g. Project/bcel.in
6. You can find the result of basic analysis in outputpath that is decribed in .in file
7. if you want to change outputpath or something, you can edit .in file and reanalysis - e.g. type 'y'
8. Next (if you type 'n'), you can find the result of further analysis by rules and actions of violaiton, globalTypes and separation
9. violation: the relation between packages is considered as a violation, so that you can find violation dependencies in outputpath directory (type dependencies, layer module dependencies)
10. ignore: dependencies in ignore are exempted in analysis, so that you can find LMSEdgesIgnore_xxx graphs 
11. separation: separation of package into specified layer module groups - see RestructureFinalPDG.dot
